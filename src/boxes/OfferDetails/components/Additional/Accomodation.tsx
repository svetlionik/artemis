        Finding a place to stay can be frustrating at the beginning. That is why
        we can accommodate you in a single room in one of our corporate
        apartments for the first 12 months. Should you decide to self-arrange
        your accommodation, we will sponsor you with 250 Euro, per month for the
        rest of the period.
